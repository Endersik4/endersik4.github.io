# MyWebsite
My first own website, which I made to better present my portfolio with descriptions.<br/>
In 2021 I had to do a final project (website) as an assignment in my computer science school.<br/> 
A project that should include everything I learned in these classes. <br/>
You could choose any topic you wanted, but I decided to make a site about me.<br/>
How I started with programming, modeling, what games I made, what tutorials I watched.<br/>
During those 2 years, the website was updated because there were a few things that were useless, but were necessary for the assignment.<br/>
The Website is in polish.<br/>
