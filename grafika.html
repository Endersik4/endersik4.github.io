									Greek Temple<br />- I designed it by myself and made it without tutorials.
									It took me about 150 hours to make the greek temple (a lot of time was spent on texturing,
									which I did for the first time and finding textures), but the longest part was testing and
									fixing bugs while creating this model (I experienced a crash every 2-3 minutes for about 10-15
									seconds each time). There were four things that didn't turn out right in this sanctuary:
									<br />-Grain: I don't know why, but it's annoying.
									<br />-Fire: The fire didn't turn out as I wanted it to; it was supposed to look prettier and more realistic (like at 3:02 in this video),
									but if I had tried to do it, the fire alone would have taken up more than 400GB.
									<br />-The fire that is there now: I had to come up with a different kind of fire and found a tutorial that showed me how to do it
									without using up all those GB, but as a result, the fire has an annoying waviness on the walls.
									<br />-The fire that burned too quickly: Almost every campfire/candle burned too quickly, and it looked ugly.
									I realized this too late, and I couldn't fix it. <br /><br />
									I created the terrain for the sanctuary with some help from tutorials.
									It took me another 150 hours to create the terrain and set everything up for rendering.
									The most time-consuming part was waiting for one image to render just to see if one setting was correct.
									I didn't plan on creating this sanctuary, but it was a computer science homework assignment,
									and I thought I would create it in Blender (whereas the rest of the class was using Tinkercad).
									I decided to make it my best model in Blender without using tutorials (my Audi R8 model was made entirely from tutorials),
									and I ended up wasting 300 hours on this project, which I could have used to create several games instead. However,
									I didn't want to abandon it because I didn't want to waste the time I'd already spent, so I kept working on it until I ran out of ideas for what to add.

									AUDI R8: <br />About 60 hours of modeling the Audi using tutorials and around 2 months of creating the game and textures for it.
									<br />
									This showcase was not created by me but by UE4 - there was a template with a different car, so I
									swapped it out for the Audi. My own game and showcase of this car can be found in the <a href="gry_ue4.html"> C++->My Games section </a> of UE4 C++.
