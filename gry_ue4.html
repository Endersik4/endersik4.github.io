								<b>MARINE RUNNER</b><br/>
								<hr />
							<p>
								It's an FPS Shooter with speedy movement made in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. <br />
								I made everything in this game, except for the Music and Sounds. <br /> <br />
								The <a href="https://github.com/Endersik4/MarineRunner/blob/main/ListOfAllFeatures.md"> List of All Features </a> explains nearly every game mechanic briefly. spoiler: it's long. <br /> <br />
								I started this project on January 23, 2023, and finished on February 23, 2024. <br/>It took nearly 2000 hours to make. <br />
								The game is in state to be shipped. <br /> <br />
								I created a demo (30 minutes long) to show everything the game offers. <br />
								I plan to enter this game into the ZTGK contest in June 2024. <br />
								Below is Trailer of the demo (1:30 minutes long) and Gameplay of the demo (35 minutes long) <br /><br />
								More info at <a href="https://github.com/Endersik4/MarineRunner"> MarineRunner Github </a>

								<b>THE BINDING OF TRIANGLE</b><br/>
								<hr />
								<p>
								A side project that i was working on 02.08.2023 to 12.09.2023 as a break from my main game MarineRunner, took 100 hours to make <br />
								I decided to go back working on MarineRunner, so this project will no longer be updated.<br />
								Took approximately 100 hours to develop.<br /><br />

								<b>TRIANGLE JUMP</b>
								<br />
								<hr />
							<p>
								The fourth game I created is based on Doodle Jump. <br />
								I added new features such as SaveGame, Particle System (created by me), and Animations. <br />
								I made a difficulty system that makes it harder to get easier things as you earn more points. <br />
								I also made my own Triangle physics that can be easily changed.<br />
								This game took a long time to make, even though it doesn't look like it, because there are many things that are not visible here, such as what happens if the platform spawns too high? What if a broken platform spawns multiple times, etc.<br />
								These things took the longest to implement.<br />
								The game was created in 20 days (from 31.12.2021 to 20.01.2022).<br />

								<b>SOLAR SYSTEM</b>
								<br />
								<hr />
								This is already the third game I have created.<br/>
								My Physics teacher announced that we had to make a presentation or some other artistic work,<br />
								so I thought I would create a game, and that's what it is.<br />
								I gathered information about the planets from various sources (mostly Wikipedia),<br />
								and it is not copied but changed to look better and be in "one sentence," and it took me the whole day.<br />
								I downloaded the planet textures from a website that collaborates with NASA and received these textures from them.<br />
								The music playing in the background changes randomly every time you start the game (there are six different tracks).<br />
								It was created in about a month.<br />

							<b>AUDIR8</b>
							<br/>
							<hr />
							The second game I created showcases a 3D model of an Audi R8 that I made myself (with tutorials) in around 50-60 hours in Blender.<br />
							The game was supposed to be about simply showcasing this car in the best possible way, but instead,<br />
							I decided to add many other things. At the end, there is a Blur effect that shouldn't be there,<br />
							and the background soundtrack was created by my sister. All the models in this game are from the internet,<br />
							and I only created this "exhibition" and the Audi R8 model, which doesn't change the fact that there was<br />
							still a lot of work to be done - it took me about 2 months due to school.<br />

								<b>TETRIS</b>
								<br />
								<hr />
								This is my first game in UE4 (without tutorials, overall my fifth game). It was supposed to be a small game with only basic functions<br />
								(just like the game I made in CODEBLOCKS in the C++->MY GAMES tab),<br />
								but somehow I ended up adding HOLD, MENU, How to play, points, pause, etc.<br />
								It was created in about 3 weeks.<br />
