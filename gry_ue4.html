								MARINE RUNNER (status as of 31.07.2023)
								<br />
								<br />
								MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077 My biggest and most ambitious project. <br />
								It was time for more complex games, not some tiny ones. <br />
								I wanted to create movement like in Ghostrunner and shooting mechanics like in Cyberpunk 2077 <br />
								The game is in development, there is still a lot to do. <br />
								I started this project on 27.01.2023 and by 15.05.2023 I have spent 953h on this game (673 Unreal Engine, 280 Blender). <br />
								MarineRunner runs on Unreal Engine 5. <br />
								(Everything is coded from scratch in C++ using Unreal Engine tools).
								<br /><br />

								MarineRunner demo to show the current status.  <br />
								This is just a demo for demonstration, I plan to add more things in the future.  <br />
								Currently the game features: Dash, Slow Motion, Grappling Hook, Sliding, Pull up on the edge, Wallrun.
								Picking up and dropping items, chest with random items or resources with or without a pin, exploding barrels  <br />
								Five different types of weapons - pistol, machine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenade launcher  <br />
								Five different types of enemies - enemy with a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a grenade launcher <br />
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFB4vfd2Eg"> ALBERTOS </a> - a robot friend that can craft items such as ammunition, weapons, first aid kits....  <br />
								This robot also has an inventory that stores everything you can pick up (resources, weapons, ammunition...).  <br /> <br />
								Probably this level will never be used in the future, because I have other plans for this game in level design.
								<br />

								TRIANGLE JUMP
								<br /><br />
								The fourth game I created is based on Doodle Jump.
								I added new features such as SaveGame, Particle System (created by me), and Animations.
								I made a difficulty system that makes it harder to get easier things as you earn more points.
								I also made my own Triangle physics that can be easily changed.
								This game took a long time to make, even though it doesn't look like it, because there are many things that are not visible here, such as what happens if the platform spawns too high? What if a broken platform spawns multiple times, etc.
								These things took the longest to implement.
								<br />The game was created in 20 days (from 31.12.2021 to 20.01.2022).<br />

								SOLAR SYSTEM
								<br /><br />
								This is already the third game I have created.
								My Physics teacher announced that we had to make a presentation or some other artistic work,
								so I thought I would create a game, and that's what it is.
								I gathered information about the planets from various sources (mostly Wikipedia),
								and it is not copied but changed to look better and be in "one sentence," and it took me the whole day.
								I downloaded the planet textures from a website that collaborates with NASA and received these textures from them.
								The music playing in the background changes randomly every time you start the game (there are six different tracks).
								It was created in about a month.

							<p>AUDIR8</p>
							The second game I created showcases a 3D model of an Audi R8 that I made myself (with tutorials) in around 50-60 hours in Blender.
							The game was supposed to be about simply showcasing this car in the best possible way, but instead,
							I decided to add many other things. At the end, there is a Blur effect that shouldn't be there,
							and the background soundtrack was created by my sister. All the models in this game are from the internet,
							and I only created this "exhibition" and the Audi R8 model, which doesn't change the fact that there was
							still a lot of work to be done - it took me about 2 months due to school.

								TETRIS
								<br /><br />
								This is my first game in UE4 (without tutorials, overall my fifth game). It was supposed to be a small game with only basic functions
								(just like the game I made in CODEBLOCKS in the C++->MY GAMES tab),
								but somehow I ended up adding HOLD, MENU, How to play, points, pause, etc.
								It was created in about 3 weeks.
